### Downloading Modpacks Built with GitHub Actions

### Use packwiz-installer

[packwiz-installer allows you to install and update a packwiz modpack](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/)

### Nix (flake) users

see packaged forge and modpack in `flake.nix`

## Development

See detailed usage at <https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/creating/getting-started/>.

### Managing Modpack Files

- Copy files to the desired folder (e.g., `config/ftbquests/quests`).
- Execute `packwiz refresh`.
- Commit changes with Git.

## Develop

### Managing Mods

#### Mods from CurseForge or Modrinth

Install mods with:
```
packwiz curseforge install https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/<mod id>
packwiz modrinth install https://modrinth.com/mod/<mod id>
```

This generates a `.pw.toml` file in the `mods` folder to record mod information. The `side` field specifies whether the mod is for the client, server, or both (`both, client, server`).

(Optional) After adding CurseForge mods, run `fixup.sh` to generate download links. This requires [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq). The script is sourced from [Misterio77/Modpack](https://github.com/Misterio77/Modpack).

- Update mods with `packwiz update [mod]`.
- To update all mods: `packwiz update --all`.

#### Directly Provided JAR Files

Handle them the same way as managing modpack files.

#### Providing Alternative Download Links

Manually write a `.pw.toml` file with the file name, download URL, and hash.

Example:
```toml
name = "Flamingo"
filename = "flamingo.jar"
side = "both"

[download]
url = "https://example.com/flamingo.jar"

# A number of tools can generate the hash for you, including 7-zip and sha256sum
# packwiz supports a number of hashes, including sha256, sha512, sha1 and md5
hash-format = "sha256"
hash = "b22d1d8fe5752533954028172c9bf3ac01b57f40c82946a3e7b1eaff389e2b87"
